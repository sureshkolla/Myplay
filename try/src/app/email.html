Shivika will reach out to you to schedule the interview today. We will meet at 3 and discuss.

Below are some of the questions team got. I will share as I get.

1. What are advantages of Angular2 framework?
============================================
	1.angular2 is 5 times faster to angularjs.
	2.CROSS PLATFORM:Mobile suppoert: angularjs not built for Mobile devices,
	 for that we have to install the thirdpartty frameworks.
	 it, will support all the devices with SAP
	
	3.Improveed modularity, dependency injection and testability(karma),Aimation
	4.component based development:Every thing is a componet, componets are build a blocks of applications. Code reuse.
	5.Strong and Flexible Routing
	6.More language choices we can use any of these
		EcmaScipt 6
		EcmaScipt 5
		Typescript
		dart
		purescript
	
	7.Typescript(Microsoft) is fully OOps

2. What is Angular2?
	AngularJS is most popular JavaScript framework available today for creating web applications. 
	And now Angular 2 and TypeScript are bringing true object oriented web development to the mainstream.
	
3.What is difference b/w factory and service?
	The difference between factory and service is just like the difference between a function and an object
	factory
	=======
	Gives us the function's return value ie. You just create an object, add properties based on logic to it, then return that same object.
	When you pass this service into your controller, those properties on the object will now be available in that controller
	 through your factory. (Hypothetical Scenario)
	 
	 service
	 ======
	 Gives us the instance of a function (object)- You just instantiated with the ‘new’ 
	 keyword and you’ll add properties to ‘this’ and the service will return ‘this’.
	 When you pass the service into your controller,those properties on ‘this’ will now be available on that controller through your service. 

4. What is directives?
	To register directives we use @Directive meta-data annotation.
	Directive is used to add behavior to an existing DOM element.
	Directive is use to design re-usable components.
	Many directives can be used per DOM element.
	Directive doesn't use View.


5.What are the core directive of angular?
Components—directives with a template.
Structural directives—change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
Attribute directives—change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.

you will get ng-app, ng-model and ng-bind in the core angular.js module.

6.What is databinding in angular?
	Data-binding in AngularJS apps is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components.
	When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.it's called two way binding'
	
7.what is scope variable?
	The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).
	The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.
	The scope is available for both the view and the controller.

8.How we can pass values within controller?
One way to share variables across multiple controllers is to create a service and inject it in any controller where you want to use it.

9.What is digest cycle?
They are similar in that they both check what's changed and update the UI and fire any watchers.

10.What are the templates in angular?
	Inline -template
	Separate file:
 



Module
Component
Template
Metadata
Data Binding
Service
Directive
Dependency Injection
